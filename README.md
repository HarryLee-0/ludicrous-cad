some rather strange cad creations

Inspired by the Modern Art Destroyer, a concept made for a group project from class, I present, the Laggy Unnecessary Device Incorporating Copious Resources and Ominously Unhinged Spider-thingy (LUDICROUS)!

Note: Unfortunately, the .STL file of the CAD is 1.17 GB large on Coarse resolution, and thats twice GitHub's recommended max file size, so I can't really upload it... However, there is a .STEP and .X_T file, and here's a link to the OnShape document:

# 8/24/2024 - 5th Update!

ok, today we're starting things off by starting work on connecting the gearbox to leg segment 1!

hmm we need some seperators to fit the arms in

getting these numbers is very annoying... ok, its finally lined up "close enough"! ok, fixed some stuff, time to make holes in the second leg segment!

ok, made some holes, preparing to add in the second leg segment!

ok, time to connect leg segment 2 to the gearbox!

oh ive been trying to fix an issue that doesnt seems to be fixable

uh is it possible to invert the gearbox... seems like theres no fix, guess i gotta make another one!

almost there... just a couple (a lot) of mate issues...

ok gonna make a quick seperator

ok, now, its time to combine the left and right version of the new gearbox to the joint!

ok, fixed a couple things, added the connecting thing, and the joint looks good!

probably want to make some brackets for the parts where it connects to the center, and add a couple bolts there... ok, since document names have gotten too long, leg has been shortened to L (so L1 is leg segment 1), and joint has been shortened to J (so J1 is joint 1)

bracket! ok, adding it... (hope that all measurements are correct...)

ok! it matches up nicely! time to add bolts and stuff!

ok, maybe a bit overkill but whatever

wait im gonna quickly put what we have so far together to see what we have

anyways, its time to start work on the second joint! the gearbox should be rotating and one degree of freedom! i dont think we will need any fancy design choices (*cough cough* second gearbox *cough cough*), so, for the sake of time, i think we should reuse the first gearbox! just kidding! turns out, my brain and OCD really wants to make another gearbox, so we're making another one! (thanks a lot brain!)

ok, setting up files...

ok, renamed a couple files, time to make the gearbox! ok, made a hole, and fixed some previous sketch! recreated part of leg 2, starting gearing layout... ok! layout done! starting plate... ok! plate done! starting pocketing... ok! pocketing done! oops forgot about spacers... ok, spacers added!

wow, really speedrunning gearboxes? oh right shafts! ok, hex shafts added!

ok, this is my last session for tonight! tommorow, let's assemble the joint 2 gearbox, then start work on the foot, and then hopefully wrap everything together and connect it to the center! ok, good night!

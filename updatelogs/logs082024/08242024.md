ok, today we're starting things off by starting work on connecting the gearbox to leg segment 1!

hmm we need some seperators to fit the arms in

getting these numbers is very annoying... ok, its finally lined up "close enough"! ok, fixed some stuff, time to make holes in the second leg segment!

ok, fixed a couple things, added the connecting thing, and the joint looks good!

probably want to make some brackets for the parts where it connects to the center, and add a couple bolts there... ok, since document names have gotten too long, leg has been shortened to L (so L1 is leg segment 1), and joint has been shortened to J (so J1 is joint 1)

bracket! ok, adding it... (hope that all measurements are correct...)

ok! it matches up nicely! time to add bolts and stuff!

ok, maybe a bit overkill but whatever

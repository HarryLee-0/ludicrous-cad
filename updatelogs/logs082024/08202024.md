# 8/20/2024 - 1st Update!

look, a new repository! this time on my alt/original account! (why? idk) (well, when you read this, i may have transfered ownership to my usual account but whatever) anyways, whats the idea? im gonna draw a quick sketch (physical, on paper) of what im envisioning...

ok, so this was an idea inspired by a CAD i made for a school project

it was a really silly idea, and i think it would be cool to try to take inspiration of its design and make a very cursed frc robot design! so here's the (physical, not CAD) sketch of it:

there are only 2 people on this planet that get the joke in the bottom right of the paper, if you don't get the joke, dont worry about it! ok, time to set up an onshape document and make some folders in here!

gonna quickly cad a simple base so i can think about what to do next... ok, working on the drive train right now (technically it doesnt drive but whatever)

ok, im gonna try something new. for every commit in these update logs, maybe i'll put a little line break or whatever its called to serpeate between commits. also, how do you export these CADs...

# 8/20/2024 - 1st Update!

look, a new repository! this time on my alt/original account! (why? idk) (well, when you read this, i may have transfered ownership to my usual account but whatever) anyways, whats the idea? im gonna draw a quick sketch (physical, on paper) of what im envisioning...

ok, so this was an idea inspired by a CAD i made for a school project

![spooder](</updatelogs/images/082024/08202024 - 1.png>)

it was a really silly idea, and i think it would be cool to try to take inspiration of its design and make a very cursed frc robot design! so here's the (physical, not CAD) sketch of it:

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08202024 - 2.png>)

there are only 2 people on this planet that get the joke in the bottom right of the paper, if you don't get the joke, dont worry about it! ok, time to set up an onshape document and make some folders in here!

gonna quickly cad a simple base so i can think about what to do next... ok, working on the drive train right now (technically it doesnt drive but whatever)

ok, im gonna try something new. for every commit in these update logs, maybe i'll put a little line break or whatever its called to serpeate between commits. also, how do you export these CADs...

so uh, small problem, idk what to do next... i guess ill work on the arms? i have absolutely no clue if the things im cadding are legal for an actual frc bot, but whatever. so, the first part of the "arms" is the part that connects with the robot. the arm segment, (labeled center -> joint 1) should be able to move in two directions, up and down (to the floor), and left and right (to the side of the robot). 

ok, so im considering which one to be "above" the other/closer to the center in parts. we can have the motors moving it up and down attached to something moved by left and right, or we can have left and right attached to something moving up and down... i guess up and down should be surrounded by the left to right

oh wait, but before that, we need to add some bumpers!

bumpers made!

ok, gonna head back to the master sketch and work on the positions of stuff... ok, idk if i will continue with this (probably will), but here's the idea for the center of the robot:

so the arms will fit in the "windows"!

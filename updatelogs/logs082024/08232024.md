# 8/23/2024 - 4th Update!

ok, time to start connecting the left right gearboxes! ok, fixed a couple stuff earlier today, but now, i think i should find the position of the gearbox connectors using some drawing

hmm

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 1.png>)

lets get actual measurements now! 

```
orange circle diameter = 11.336117 (x = 9.711614, y = 5.847401)
motor distance from diameter = (x = 4.836466, y = 2.943410)
bar (ideally) = (x = +0.5 to -0.5, y = around 0 and towards negative side)
```

ok, did it in desmos!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 2.png>)

so, we center our bar here at (-2.99, -4.81) (rounded) here's the calcuator if you're interested! https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hlxdjqqjt5

since d=26.804662336313818, we have around 53.6 degrees of rotation, which isn't too bad (well, its actually less then that irl, since we have a giant metal bar taking up some space)

ok, measurements updated! i should probably make like some for of way for the box tubing to connect with the gearbox plates, hold on...

so ive been thinking, and i dont think the is the best solution. this increases the dimensions of the gearbox, which would be a problem when connecting six of these into one central robot, so i think i should focus more on how to mount this to the center of the robot, where the side box tubes should provide better support for vertical things...

however, checking the CAD, it appears as if we only had 16 degrees of rotation this hole time, because we hadn't accounted for the motors hitting the side box tubing. this means we need to make the robot bigger! (or gearbox smaller)

ok, the distance has been increased, and it seems we may have roughly 120 degrees of rotation? ok so we need to move those extended things to the top. just fixed a ton of mating issues! fixed even more issues (some gearbox plates were 0.125 inches thick instead of 0.25, mate features got very strange in the "joint" assembly), but its looking correct now!

just did some math, 

$\frac{17.5-\left(2*4.610650+7.997583\right)}{2}+2.293307 = 2.4338655$

2.4338655 will be the length of the vertical thing

ok, almost there! just need to copy it to the bottom (previously deleted it because its basically a copy paste and it would be annoying to do things twice)

ok, done!

ok, time for joint 1! basically, we've been working on the center "joint" (joint 0 i guess?), so now, we've paseed the center, and we've passed the first leg segment, so now we are between the first and second leg segments, where we have joint 1! last night, i was thinking about this, instead of falling asleep, and i think i have an idea on how to do this. so, the thing with joint 1, is that i want it to have almost 180 degrees of rotation (from the first leg segment to straight out), and i don't think our first gearbox, is capable of this, so i think we need a new gearbox...

ok, ive though of a solution, we will have two leg section two, and we will make a hole at the end of the first leg section, then create a gear box that appears perpendicular to the first leg setcion, and is connected to the first section and rotates the second leg section

ok, hole made in first leg section! ok, so hmm, the first gear ratio was 1:6, what should this one be? maybe 1:8?

hmm

ok, just rotated everything by 90 degrees because "i think itll look cooler"

not my proudest job pocketing, but it'll do

![huh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 7.png>)

oops forgot about spacers... ok, shafts and spacers done? moving on to assembly! huh, good thing i caught this issue early... (basically, the bearing would have to exist inside the motor, which, obviously, can't happen) ok, fixed it by increasing the gear size!

---

ok, continuing assembly of the new gearbox from last session! ok, motors in! hmm gear work... and its mostly finished!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 8.png>)

hmm sometings not right... ok, just fixed it!

i have an idea for next session (tomorrow), maybe allow it to be more "inside" the first leg segment. the first leg segment can be a bit longer, and the gearbox can have holes on the other side to connect with it, just an idea for now!

ok, that's it for me tonight! no way, 5 hours CADing today? (oops i have actual school robotics related things i forgot about uh oh, gonna start working on that for the rest of tonight!) anyways, i'm hoping to finish this in probably two more days, assuming i wake up earlier tommorow, so yeah, good night!

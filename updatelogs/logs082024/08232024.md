# 8/23/2024 - 4th Update!

ok, time to start connecting the left right gearboxes! ok, fixed a couple stuff earlier today, but now, i think i should find the position of the gearbox connectors using some drawing

hmm

lets get actual measurements now! 

```
orange circle diameter = 11.336117 (x = 9.711614, y = 5.847401)
motor distance from diameter = (x = 4.836466, y = 2.943410)
bar (ideally) = (x = +0.5 to -0.5, y = around 0 and towards negative side)
```

ok, did it in desmos!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 2.png>)

so, we center our bar here at (-2.99, -4.81) (rounded) here's the calcuator if you're interested! https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hlxdjqqjt5

since d=26.804662336313818, we have around 53.6 degrees of rotation, which isn't too bad (well, its actually less then that irl, since we have a giant metal bar taking up some space)

ok, measurements updated! i should probably make like some for of way for the box tubing to connect with the gearbox plates, hold on...

so ive been thinking, and i dont think the is the best solution. this increases the dimensions of the gearbox, which would be a problem when connecting six of these into one central robot, so i think i should focus more on how to mount this to the center of the robot, where the side box tubes should provide better support for vertical things...

however, checking the CAD, it appears as if we only had 16 degrees of rotation this hole time, because we hadn't accounted for the motors hitting the side box tubing. this means we need to make the robot bigger! (or gearbox smaller)

ok, the distance has been increased, and it seems we may have roughly 120 degrees of rotation? ok so we need to move those extended things to the top. just fixed a ton of mating issues! fixed even more issues (some gearbox plates were 0.125 inches thick instead of 0.25, mate features got very strange in the "joint" assembly), but its looking correct now!

just did some math, 

$\frac{17.5-\left(2*4.610650+7.997583\right)}{2}+2.293307 = 2.4338655$

2.4338655 will be the length of the vertical thing

ok, almost there! just need to copy it to the bottom (previously deleted it because its basically a copy paste and it would be annoying to do things twice)

ok, done!

# 8/23/2024 - 4th Update!

ok, time to start connecting the left right gearboxes! ok, fixed a couple stuff earlier today, but now, i think i should find the position of the gearbox connectors using some drawing

hmm

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 1.png>)

lets get actual measurements now! 

```
orange circle diameter = 11.336117 (x = 9.711614, y = 5.847401)
motor distance from diameter = (x = 4.836466, y = 2.943410)
bar (ideally) = (x = +0.5 to -0.5, y = around 0 and towards negative side)
```

ok, did it in desmos!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08232024 - 2.png>)

so, we center our bar here at (-2.99, -4.81) (rounded) here's the calcuator if you're interested! https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hlxdjqqjt5

since d=26.804662336313818, we have around 53.6 degrees of rotation, which isn't too bad (well, its actually less then that irl, since we have a giant metal bar taking up some space)

ok, measurements updated! i should probably make like some for of way for the box tubing to connect with the gearbox plates, hold on...

# 8/25/2024 - 6th Update!

ok, sixth update/day! today, we should hopefully aim to finish assembling the new (third) gearbox, and then hopefully connect the foot, and finally connect all the sections of the leg together, and then assemble the robot!

ok, first, assembling the third gearbox! so onshape has decided that it hates me today, and will try to maximize my struggles

uh

anyways, spacers done, adding motors and gears... ok, adding gears now... ok, now bolts and stuff... ok, gearbox done! well, of course im gonna go back and add sperators and connection areas for box tubing, but... you probably get what i mean

ok, time to start connecting the gearbox to the bar! ok, got the second leg section parts positioned! ok gotta make some holes in the final leg segment... wow, random blue outline in the middle of nowhere... anyways, holes made!

huh somethings a bit off... ok, its fixed, but its not done yet!

ok, im back, time to start work on connecting gearbox to leg segment 2... oh its all rotated the wrong way.

ok, i think ive figured it out, we need a thing on the gearbox plate that connects to some box tubing, then connect that with a bracket over there and over there, then connect that in the center...

time to make more holes in the second leg segment... ok i need to redo the thunder hex mates on the leg segment 2... ok, now they should spin with the hex shaft!

hmm, leg segment 3 connected?

ok, connected the other gearbox, and i just got a really really bad idea. what if we added a swerve drive to every single leg of the robot? (for this CAD, we dont really care about the costs, and no ones actually gonna program this robot, so why not?)

# 8/25/2024 - 6th Update!

ok, sixth update/day! today, we should hopefully aim to finish assembling the new (third) gearbox, and then hopefully connect the foot, and finally connect all the sections of the leg together, and then assemble the robot!

ok, first, assembling the third gearbox! so onshape has decided that it hates me today, and will try to maximize my struggles

uh

![uh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 1.png>)

anyways, spacers done, adding motors and gears... ok, adding gears now... ok, now bolts and stuff... ok, gearbox done! well, of course im gonna go back and add sperators and connection areas for box tubing, but... you probably get what i mean

![alt text](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 2.png>)

ok, time to start connecting the gearbox to the bar! ok, got the second leg section parts positioned! ok gotta make some holes in the final leg segment... wow, random blue outline in the middle of nowhere... anyways, holes made!

huh somethings a bit off... ok, its fixed, but its not done yet!

---

ok, im back, time to start work on connecting gearbox to leg segment 2... oh its all rotated the wrong way.

ok, i think ive figured it out, we need a thing on the gearbox plate that connects to some box tubing, then connect that with a bracket over there and over there, then connect that in the center...

time to make more holes in the second leg segment... ok i need to redo the thunder hex mates on the leg segment 2... ok, now they should spin with the hex shaft!

hmm, leg segment 3 connected?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 3.png>)

ok, connected the other gearbox, and i just got a really really bad idea. what if we added a swerve drive to every single leg of the robot? (for this CAD, we dont really care about the costs, and no ones actually gonna program this robot, so why not?)

![uh oh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 4.png>)

```
"Henry, what did you do this Sunday?"
"On this six legged robot, i decided it would be funny for every leg for the robot to be a swerve drive!"
```

anyways, time to work on this!

ok sizes fixed, ok bellypan time! ok gotta update the sizes once again... in the middle of fillet... assembling...

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 5.png>)

gotta add the connection in the middle (theres nothing connecting it to arm segment 3 right now)

why does this look a bit ominous?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 6.png>)

ok we have a couple gussets to make...

oops

![uhh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 7.png>)

---

ok, we're back and its time to fix gussets and hopefully start final robot assembly! ok, gotta redo `joint (L2 to L3)` no way, i guessed two measurements correctly/perfectly! ok, the bracket looks good! however, it turns out i only guessed one of the measurements correctly... but its all good now!

its time... for assembling a leg!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 8.png>)

ok, while assembling i did notice we are missing some bolts in some places, and that we havent found a way to connect the center joint outer gearbox to the frame just yet

turns out that thing in the center is not oriented correctly one sec... ok, fixed, and bolts added!

so the centers of the center of the gearbox supporting box tubing is 10.856406 inches apart, and the furthest edges are 11.856406 inches apart... this is going to be tricky to add...

ok, im back, and i think i have an idea... onshape is not appreciating the number of things it has to render. onshape is taking around 15 second to do a single action, but so far, removed the holes of the sides of the vertical box tubing of the structure, next is to make new holes for the gearbox! ok, holes are slowly being made, but onshape is taking a while to process things...

YES! things are connecting...

woo!

![waw](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 9.png>)

ok, it seems like the last thing i need to do is add bolts to connect the gearboxes to the frame... oh somethings wrong with that gusset

oh.

![oops](</updatelogs/images/082024/08252024 - 10.png>)

ok, bolts and stuff have been added! gonna do a final check, then export!

here's some stats of the robot, according to onshape (if i did it correctly?)

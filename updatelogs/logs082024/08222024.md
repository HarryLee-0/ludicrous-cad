# 8/22/2024 - 3rd Update!

ok, today we start work on the gearbox around the gearbox! ok, time to start working on the cad! gonna quickly draw my idea...

so yeah, basically the gearbox around the gearbox. what if i can reuse the same gearbox...

ok time to edit the inner plate of the gearbox to also have side things... wait a second things might colide with each other... gonna rethink this...

ok, sketch done, pocketing time! actually, im gonna make the side things wider, one sec... ok, fixed something wrong with lightening, the plate is here!

ok, the wider version has been made!

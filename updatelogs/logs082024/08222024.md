# 8/22/2024 - 3rd Update!

ok, today we start work on the gearbox around the gearbox! ok, time to start working on the cad! gonna quickly draw my idea...

so yeah, basically the gearbox around the gearbox. what if i can reuse the same gearbox...

ok time to edit the inner plate of the gearbox to also have side things... wait a second things might colide with each other... gonna rethink this...

ok, sketch done, pocketing time! actually, im gonna make the side things wider, one sec... ok, fixed something wrong with lightening, the plate is here!

ok, the wider version has been made!

ok, im back from going outside, time to work on the gearbox around the gearbox! time to go shopping for parts (looking for another hex shaft -> box tubing thing) ooo i think i found a very good one (1/2" Hex ID x SplineXL OD MotionX Hub (Aluminum, #10-32 Tapped)) now, im currently replacing the previous gearbox's hub with this one, and spacers are being annoying... ok, replacements are done! currently redoing the box tubing connector so that it has more places for the hub to connect with

ok, fixed more issues, we're now perfectly centered!

ok, first rough concept, need to shorten and increase the size of some stuff

ok, left right gearbox now has a shorter output hex shaft!

ok, just copy pasted, and did the mate stuff again, and we have a gearbox on the top and bottom now!

just edited what is fixed in the assembly, and now the middle turns! ok, just a thought, it could be more compact by moving the connector lower... ok, looks more compact now! here's a side by side comparison!

ok! good progress today! next, we need to some vertical box tubing, so that the top and bottom are securely connected! unforutantely, i have to go to sleep now, so good night!

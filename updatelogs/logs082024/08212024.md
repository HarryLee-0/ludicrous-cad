# 8/21/2024 - 2nd Update!

ok, so, from yesterday, i realized that there are no gears in the CAD thingy that are big enough for it (1:6), so i think it'll have to be a two stage gearbox, probably 1:2, then 1:3. or maybe 1:1.5, then 1:4. anyways, time to re do the gearbox CAD! yeah i should probably just start over with the cad... ok, fixing sketches, and now pocketing's done!

next, assembly! yay! the gears mesh nicely! now to do this a couple more times... also, we do need to move the spacer on the very top and bottom, since they touch the gears...

still need to add the bolts and stuff, but getting there!

ok, hopefully i should be able to add the bolts and stuff now! ok, bolts and stuff has been added!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08212024 - 3.png>)

ok, time to look into how we're going to rotate this. hmm just considered the idea of turning it (roll), but that means we'll need another one lower down the leg to correct for the tilt, probably not a good idea... ok, i have found the beefiest sprocket that's in the list (i think?), and its given me an idea 

ok so i did some math, and i think this concludes that we cant let that gear poke above (we need more space for the sprocket) ok, the gearbox has become one side gear box... so i put the gearboxes together, some measurements may be off, but let me quickly make something cover the gear first... ok, the gear's now covered!

ok, we're hopefully done with the gearbox, time to work on things beyond the gearbox part! (that, of course, being the part that surround the gearbox) ok, first, lets figure out how to attach box tubing to the part after the rotating part...

hmm... found a possibly good piece... ok, should probably work on the master sketch for an arm... im playing around with lengths to see if its good, onshape is pretty cool with inverse kinematics... i should probably make it into one line shouldn't i...

wait it would be cool if the center rotated... ok, i have replaced the fasten mate with a revolute mate, gotta change a couple more things... ok, made a hole for the hex shaft! ok, i still need to get bolts and stuff in, but looking good!

finally fixed the measurements, gonna add some bolts then commit!

ok, its finally spaced properly!

ok, we're back again! time to work on something to connect gearbox to future turning thingy! ok, i think i have an idea, the current design, if the arm reaches to "the handles", it goes a bit more than 90 degrees, around +45 to -45 degrees, so, im thinking of adding a one inch thing above that connects the gearbox plates to some box tubing, which can be bolted to a spinning thingy, which we can use to power turning! ok, the gear plates are 1.875 inches apart

ok, now we have the little thingy on top! (had to redo a lot of the mates) ok, update, we somehow, out of nowhere, have 2.125 inches of space in between. ok, lots of pocketing issues were just now fixed!

![seperator thingies added!](</updatelogs/images/082024/08212024 - 7.png>)

ok time to look for a sprocket thing! i just got a really bad idea that might work, basically, we do this all over again, but we attach hex shafts to the top and bottom of this already existing gearbox! oh wait, forgot to do the washer bolt thing, gonna do that real quick... ok done! also fixed some spacing issues in the gearbox part studio!

ok, so, for tommorow, we're gonna make the gearbox of the gearbox! ok, good night!

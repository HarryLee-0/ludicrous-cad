# 8/21/2024 - 2nd Update!

ok, so, from yesterday, i realized that there are no gears in the CAD thingy that are big enough for it (1:6), so i think it'll have to be a two stage gearbox, probably 1:2, then 1:3. or maybe 1:1.5, then 1:4. anyways, time to re do the gearbox CAD! yeah i should probably just start over with the cad... ok, fixing sketches, and now pocketing's done!

next, assembly! yay! the gears mesh nicely! now to do this a couple more times... also, we do need to move the spacer on the very top and bottom, since they touch the gears...

still need to add the bolts and stuff, but getting there!
